# Privacy Policy for NovaSpace

NovaSpace does not collect any personal information from users. The app does not require you to create an account or provide any personal details to use its features.

Currently, NovaSpace does not collect any analytics or usage tracking data. In future versions, we may add analytics tools to help us understand how the app is used and improve its features. If we do so, this Privacy Policy will be updated to describe what data is collected and how it is used.

We do not share any user data with third parties.

NovaSpace can be used by people of all ages, but it is not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will promptly delete it.

If you contact us directly (for example, via email for support), we will only use your email address to respond to your request and will not store it beyond what is necessary.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [catops.dev@gmail.com] or [bsirinath@gmail.com].

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in our app or data practices. Please review it periodically for any changes.
